# Overcomplicated Caesar Cipher

- Just a normal caesar-cipher generator...but written in AT&T x86_64 assembly (Why am I doing this anyway).
- It's even more ridiculous to have it tested with higher level programming language, Rust (because it's much more productive to write caesar cipher program in Rust or any high level programming languages).
- Anyway, I'm just doing it just for the sake of exploring and understanding computer architecture.

## Installation

Hmmm, actually I am also not sure but I think it's:

- GAS compiler
- Rust (and Cargo)
- Make

## Usage

Too lazy too write this. Will add more later.

## Contributing

Nah, I don't think it's worth it anyway. You can just copy and paste, steal it, or even recreate to do something better, robust and more interesting that this.
